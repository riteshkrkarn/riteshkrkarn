# Hi, I'm Ritesh Kumar Karn

I'm a passionate and curious developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I love building creative solutions through code and constantly exploring new technologies. My main focus is web development, and Iâ€™m also diving into backend and Web3 development using Solidity and Ethers.js. Always open to collaboration and learning!
